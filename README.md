# BigFramework
A framework to quickly make node setups / configure parameters in Houdini. To those unfamiliar with [Python Scripting in Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/hom/hou/index.html), this is something you can put in a Houdini shelftool (or anywhere else that uses Houdini's Python API, which is the module 'hou') and make use of.

I have been meaning to post this to the internet in the entire year ago that I made this. I can explain it further if there's any interest -- I half expect that no one finds it too cool which is fine with me, I've already gotten alot of use out of it :)

Another note: this isn't the most updated version of this (I have modified it to be able to do more for my own tasks and have ommited these modifications for simplicity).
